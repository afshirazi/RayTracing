# Ray tracer

Basic ray tracer. Currently supports:

- Phong lighting model
- Specular-specular reflections
- Point lights

A few things I'm interested in adding are Cook-Torrance (or any other model), area lights, and transparent objects with refraction. Maybe I should refactor my code before that though.
