# Ray tracer

Basic ray tracer. Currently supports:

- Phong lighting model
- Specular-specular reflections
- Point lights

# To-do list:
- [ ] Refactor the code
  - [ ] Move to Rust (no real reason other than easier OOP probably?)
  - [ ] Implement as trait + methods
- [ ] Add spatial hashing to objects (if I decide to support large enough scenes)
- [ ] Add different lighting model (Cook-Torrance maybe)
- [ ] Add refractions/transparency
- [ ] Run it on gpu
- [ ] Make it real-time
